A 3d version of the old Win98 Columns (https://archive.org/details/win3_COLUMNS)

This is a game I wanted to create as a 3d version of the Win3/98 old Columns game.

But it included a new version of gameplay (since 3d allows it) where colums can be rotated around their axes to reveal new color arrangements.

This is from around 2003 and is using VisualBasic .NET.

Also has a setup for installation.
